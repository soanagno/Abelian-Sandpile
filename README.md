## Cellular Automata: Abelian-Sandpile and generalised Game of Life

Implementation of generalirsed cellular automata models using NumPy containers for optimised run times, avoiding nested for loops where possible.

Fig.  Sandpile converged state for a 128x128 array with initial state equal to 48 for each cell.
